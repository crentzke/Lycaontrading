          The  African Wild Dog (Lycaon Pictus) has developed a highly specialized social system that allows them to live and hunt more effectively often bringing down much larger prey than predators their size should. They are masters of using collaboration to improve their probability of survival. The dog is endangered.

          <h1>Mentorship</h1>
<p>As a South African business we know how important it is to give back to our community. For this reason we wish to uplift local South Africans through a mentorship program that offers young entrepreneurs the opportunity of learning how to build a sustainable income. This is achieved through instilling in them important business and life skills and teaching them how to provide for themselves through trading African markets. We are not just simply giving them a job, we are empowering them with skills that will sustain them throughout their lives.</p>
<p>That skill is to earn income for themselves from the financial markets. With this skill they are able to set up their own trading businesses. As an entrepreneurial company we believe that trading is a business and not a job. Each trader needs to run his or her trading like a business, taking responsibility for every aspect. In the process of learning trading, trainees will also learn work ethic, discipline and many other life skills that will assist them in their future endeavours.</p>
