          The  African Wild Dog (Lycaon Pictus) has developed a highly specialized social system that allows them to live and hunt more effectively often bringing down much larger prey than predators their size should. They are masters of using collaboration to improve their probability of survival. The dog is endangered.

This laid the foundation for developing his own proprietary trading system.

He enjoys writing technical articles and papers on investment systems, trading strategy, trader psychology, risk management and his real life trading experiences in the markets. He has also written a number of actionable trading plans and developed profitable trading systems.</p>
<h2>What we trade</h2>
<p>Global futures markets are our predominant focus. Favourites include the S&P e-mini contract, JSE All share index futures contract, 30 year Treasury bond futures and global commodity futures including White Maize in South Africa.</p>
<p>We trade a selection of highly liquid stocks and foreign exchange pairs using our proprietary intra-day trading strategy.</p>
<h2>How We Trade</h2>
<p>Our strategy is centered on our tested proprietary intra-day trading system and a strict; rules based approach focussing on the following areas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Risk management</li>
  <li>High expectancy opportunities.</li>
  <li>Trader collaboration to improve our results.</li>
  <li>A high work ethic to gain an edge.</li>
  <li>Trading multiple markets using one philosophy and process</li>
  <li>Scenario planning and "worst case" contingency programs to avoid catastrophes.</li>
  <li>An adaptive nature to take advantage of evolving markets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
<p>We are trend followers by nature although not in the classic trend follower mould. We always attempt to trade in the direction of the trend and attempt to ride break outs and trends or mini intraday momentum moves. Whilst markets are not always trending; if there is a trend we want to be in it. We do not want to be fighting against the crowd or trying to catch the top of an up-trend or bottom of a down-trend.</p>
<p>Often there is no trend or markets are flat or directionless, in which case we step aside completely. This is why we trade multiple markets and asset classes.</p>
<h2>We Concentrate On</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Highly liquid markets</li>
  <li>Regulated exchanges (rather than over-the-counter instruments)</li>
  <li>Active asset classes and sectors</li>
  <li>Markets that meet our filtering requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>We are always looking for high expectancy trades with low risk. I am of the belief that often times, even in flat market conditions there are mini intra-day trends formed as sentiment ebbs and flows throughout the session. These are the trends we want to capture. Markets are not efficient and participants are not rational.</p>
